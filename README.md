# CampusAssist – Marketplace Assistance Platform

CampusAssist is a task-based assistance system that connects **Buyers** (who post product requests) with **Runners** (who accept tasks and deliver products for a tip).

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Authentication
- **Signup system** with validation checks:
  - Prevents duplicate accounts using email
  - Enforces password strength and confirm-password match
  - User data stored persistently in a local **SQLite database**
  - Login session persists locally using `localStorage`
- **Login system** with validation checks:
  - Verifies email and password match
  - Stores active session details (`userName`, `userEmail`) locally
  - Redirects user after successful login

### 🛍 Buyer Mode
- Buyers can **post a request for a product** including:
  - `item_name`
  - `price`
  - `tip` (reward for the Runner)
  - `requester_email`
- Requests are stored persistently using SQLite
- Buyer dashboard displays all placed requests in **newest-first order**

### 🏃 Runner Mode
- Runners can:
  - View all **OPEN (available) requests**
  - **Accept a task**
  - **Deliver the requested product**
  - Mark request as **COMPLETED**
- Delivery validation prevents duplicate completion of tasks
